The GitHUB repository contains code that uses Gazebo to do kitting simulation. The simulation environment is based on the Agility Lab setup at NIST. There are 2 robots - a Fanuc LRMate and a Motoman sia200d being simulated that each provide a trajectory and kinematic module. In addition, the simulation provides acts as a server accepting  CRCL commands https://github.com/ros-industrial/crcl. 

The code uses gnu C++ 2011 standard in a Linux implementation, tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. The 
simulation uses  Gazebo version 9   and  Ros I version Kinetic. The use of ROS is limited, but catkin_make is used to 
compile all the packages. There are several bash scripts under the bin9 folder that can be used to launch the  with rosagilitydemo.bash 
being the ROS catkin_make launch script.
