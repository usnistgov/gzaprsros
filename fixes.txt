Problem: Gazebo will really only work with Google protobuf 2.6
This is easily violated installing anaconda which puts the latest 
protobuf in its bin (for me it was 3.11!)

Solution:
REMOVED ALL ANACONDA FROM .bashrc AND PATH.
for ubuntu xenial, installed protobuf 2.6 using source:

From: https://gist.github.com/samklr/0b8a0620f82005e7f556
libprotobuf 2.6.1: e.g. https://gist.github.com/samklr/0b8a0620f82005e7f556

But it WILL NOT BUILD OTHERWISE
