- calibrate simulated robot to gazebo model - there are errors in the ik due to incorrect lengths in links, tools, etc.
- Add light source

- Check joint limits exceeded in robot motion

Replace all boost with std C11 wherever possible. However, gazebo and ros rely on it.

GAZEBO GRIPPER ILLS

https://answers.ros.org/question/201625/turtlebot-arm-on-gazebo-lets-fall-all-grasped-objects/
illustrates adding pad to gripper and palm
The <gripper> tag is a hack that creates joints between the gripper and objects that the gripper is in contact with. This relies on a few stable contacts. You can try adjusting the <attach_steps> and <detach_steps> parameters.

Grasping of objects has improved in newer versions of Gazebo. The <gripper> is no longer needed. The caveats are that the both the gripper and objects must have good(realistic) inertia values, and you may need to tune the contact properties of the gripper.

FK from current joints such that robot coordinates translated into world coordinates

THIS MAY BE WRONG:
// Need to subtract off tool offset from robot wrist or final tcp
// there is no base, assumes robot centered at (0,0,0)
tf::Pose r_lastpose=_kinematics->FK(_nc->status.currentjoints.position);

as maybe the gripper is included in forward kinematics?
