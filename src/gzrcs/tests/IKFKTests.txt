        //RCS::Pose zero (Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1), Vector3(0.60, 0, 0.4));
        std::vector<double> oldjoints = ToVector<double> (6,0.0, 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0);
        RCS::Pose zero = kin->FK(oldjoints);
        std::cout << "Zero Pose= "   <<DumpPose(zero).c_str();
        std::vector<double> test = kin->IK(zero,oldjoints);
        std::cout << "Zero Joints" << VectorDump (test).c_str(); 

Should expect to see:

Zero Pose= Translation = 465:0:695
Rotation = 0:-0:0
Quaternion = 0:0:0:1
Zero Joints0:0:0:0:0:0:
